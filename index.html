							<h2 class="major">Disaster Tweet Classification</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/nlp.png" alt="NLP" /></span>
							
							<p>A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project aimed at classifying tweets into two categories: tweets related to real disasters and those that are not. The project utilizes NLP techniques and machine learning to automatically identify tweets containing information about actual disasters, enabling timely response and support efforts.</p>
							<h4>Key Features:</h4>
							<ol type="1">
								<li>Text Preprocessing: NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction are applied to convert raw text data into a format suitable for machine learning.</li>
								<li>Machine Learning Models: Various machine learning algorithms, such as linear SVM, are employed to classify tweets based on their content. These models are trained on labeled data to predict whether a tweet pertains to a real disaster.</li>
								<li>Performance Evaluation: The accuracy and performance of the machine learning models are assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable tweet classification. The image above is a comparison between the accuracy of the different models used.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>							
							<br>
							<h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
							<p>The term disaster tweet classification does not really clarify what this project is about, so I will do it instead. Twitter (now X, but not in my heart) is the most popular social network for real-time interaction on topics ranging from cats to national emergencies. Just like the wide variety of discussions, Twitter boasts a varied range of user ages as well. Some popular expressions used on the internet these days are, "That's fire!", "Ooh that burns", "I am shaking!" and so on. The aim of this project is to recognise that when someone tweets "That's lit!", are they talking about something that is literally on fire, constituting an emergency or are they simply amazed by something.</p>

							<p>The project aimed to simulate and understand essential networking concepts by configuring a Cisco Router and a Linux PC as a LAN switch within a virtual environment. The simulation utilized GNS3 for network emulation and Wireshark for packet analysis. Key objectives included configuring the network elements, observing MAC table updates, and implementing a spanning tree protocol for loop-free routing.
							</p>
							<h4>Key Features:</h4>
							<ol type="1">
								<li>Network Configuration: The project involved configuring a Cisco Router and a Linux PC within GNS3 to simulate a LAN switch environment. This allowed for hands-on experience in setting up network components.</li>
								<li>MAC Table Updates: During the simulation, the project explored how LAN switches update their MAC tables in response to network activity, showcasing the dynamic nature of Ethernet-based networks.</li>
								<li>Spanning Tree Protocol: An integral part of the project was the implementation and observation of a spanning tree protocol. This protocol ensures loop-free routing within the network, enhancing network reliability.</li>
								<li>Packet Analysis: Wireshark was employed to capture and analyze network packets, providing insights into network behavior, frame forwarding, and protocol operations.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Tech Stack:</h4>
							<li>Ubuntu</li>

							<li>Wireshark</li>
				
							<br>
							<h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
							<p>Computer Networks was a mandatory course during my undergrad and while I found it to be very daunting, I was also deeply interested in it. Thus, I elected to pursue the course a second time during my masters and fell in love with the simplicity and efficiency of networking algorithms. This project was an effort on my part to further solidify my understanding of the subject by practical implementation of core concepts. By successfully configuring and simulating a LAN switch environment and observing how LAN switches manage MAC tables and implement spanning tree protocols, this project enhanced my understanding of critical networking concepts and hands-on network management skills.</p>
