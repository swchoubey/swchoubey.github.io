I'm Swasti Choubey, a passionate and driven computer science professional with a focus on leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.I recently earned my Master of Computer Science degree from the University of California, Irvine and that coupled with my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering has allowed me to develop foundational knowledge in subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, Computer Networking, Computer Security, Artificial Intelligence, and Operating Systems. Over the course of my education, I have worked on object-oriented programming fundamentals and developed proficiency in Java and Python. I also have experience with C, C++ and C#.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have actively participated in workshops and events, and have attended programs on Internet of Things, Robotics, and Cybersecurity, among others. My experiences as a volunteer with the National Service Scheme have instilled in me a commitment to giving back to society and creating a positive impact.
I thrive in collaborative environments and have had the opportunity to collaborate on many incredible projects, both as a team lead and team member. These experiences have allowed me to improve my communication skills, adaptability and also taught me the importance of reliability. My dedication to excellence has been recognized through awards for academic performance and achievements in multiple domains.

I love reading and listening to music and constantly strive to discover new art to enjoy. I also enjoy learning about and keeping up with technological innovations. I am excited about the potential of technology to address societal challenges and am always eager to learn and grow as both a Software Engineer and an individual. Thank you for visiting my page!
